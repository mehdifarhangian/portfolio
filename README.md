# Data Sience Portfolio

I have created this portfolio to explain my science journey and my learnings during this journey with a public audience. I'll try to communicate some technical stuffs in a simple language. I'll add my blog posts, codes, presentations and so on in the form of codes, Python dash, R shiny, iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files. Previously, I have written the description of some of these projects in Internetrix blog. If you like to have a chat with me about the below projects or collaborations please reach out to me via mehdifarhangian@gmail.come.  


# Contents 

## 1. [CLV Measurement Tutorial](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/CLV%20Calculation%20Tutorial) 

In this project,  I provide an extended tutorial that contains all the stages of CLV measurement. It can be useful for both students and practitioners. [Link](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/CLV%20Calculation%20Tutorial). 


I'm going to extend this project by building a Shiny R app that can be used as a toy tool to test different hypothesis and different if-then Scenarios. Please let me know if you like to collaborate in this app. 

## 2. [Markov Chain and Attribution modelling](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/CLV%20Attribution)

In This project, I have introduced an novel approach to use Markov graph in attribution modelling, and showed how this approach can be customised by incorporating all the customersâ€™ life cycles. Please have a look [here](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/CLV%20Attribution). 


## 3. [Survival Analysis in Digital Marketing](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/Attribution-Survival-Analysis) 

In this project we are building a Decision Support System to determine the credit of each marketing channel by using a survival analysis approach. The article here explain the framework and methodlogoy and wi'll be updated in the future. You can access this project via [this link](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/Attribution-Survival-Analysis)

## 4. [Click Through Rate Prediction](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/CTR%20Prediction)

It is critical to have accurate model that helps us predict the click through rate and also enables us to run if-then scenarios that
discover the best features for a particular ad. In this project, I'm providing some guidelines for developing a model to predict click-through rate for ads without prior information. [link](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/CTR%20Prediction)

## 5. [Baysian A B testing](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/Bayesian%20A%20B%20testing)

Here I've  added some mathematical point regarding A B testing. We are building a dashboard that use A/B test data as the input and returns Bayesian results as well as their interpretations as the outcome. The introduction to A/B testing with some mathematical points can be access [here](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/Bayesian%20A%20B%20testing).

## 6. [Customised Strategy with CLV](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/CLV%20Visualization)

In order to determine the effect of a new product on the retention of customers, we should look for differences.
This project introduces different visualizations that helps us to analyzing differences in terms of acquisition channels or demographic characteristics (such as gender, age or geography) and so on. It can be accessed [here](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/CLV%20Visualization)

I'm building a we-based app using Python dash library. Let me know if you are interested in collaboration. 

## 7. [TV Advertisement Attribution](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/TV%20Attribution)

How can you measure the effect that TV advertising is having on web traffic and sales for your business? We have introduced a novel approach to measure the measure the impact of an event (such as a TV advertisement) on the traffic of your website by using causal
inference measured. It can be accessed [here](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/TV%20Attribution)

## 8. [Marketing Budget Optimisation](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/Budget%20Optimization)

I used some guidelines to  use linear programming to allocate budget to each marketing activity and at the same time cover all the constraints. This can be accessed [here](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/blob/master/Budget%20Optimization/_Budget_optimisation.pdf). Also, I'm working on a simulation model that allows marketers to conduct various if-then scenarios.
