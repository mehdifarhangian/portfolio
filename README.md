# Data Sience Portfolio

I have created this portfolio to explian my science journey and my learnings during this journey with a public audience. I'll try to communicate some technical stuffs in a simple language. I'll add my plog posts, codes, presentations and so on in the form of codes, Python dash, R shiny, iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files. Previously, I have written the description of some of these projects in [Internetrix blog](https://www.internetrix.com.au/blog)
