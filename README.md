# Data Sience Portfolio

I have created this portfolio to explian my science journey and my learnings during this journey with a public audience. I'll try to communicate some technical stuffs in a simple language. I'll add my plog posts, codes, presentations and so on in the form of codes, Python dash, R shiny, iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files. Previously, I have written the description of some of these projects in [Internetrix blog](https://www.internetrix.com.au/blog)

## 1. [CLV Measurement Tutorial](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/CLV%20Calculation%20Tutorial) 

In this project, in  I provide an extended tutorial that contains all the satges of CLV measurment. It can be useful for both students and practitioners.


I'm going to extend this project by building a Shiny R app that can be used as a toy tool to test diffrent hypothesis and different if-then Senarios. Please let me know if you like to collaborate in this app. 

## 2. [Markov Chain and Attribution modelling](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/CLV%20Attribution)

In This project, I have introduced an novel approach to use Markov graph in attribution modelling, and showed how this approach can be customised by incorporating all the customersâ€™ life cycles.

## 3. [Survival Analysis in Digital Marketing](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/Attribution-Survival-Analysis) 

In this project we are building a Decision Support System to determine the credit of each marketing channel by using a survival analysis approach. The article here explain the framework and mathodlogoy and w'll be updted in the future. 

## 4. [Click Through Rate Prediction](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/CTR%20Prediction)

It is critical to have accurate model that helps us predict the click through rate and also enables us to run if-then scenarios that
discover the best features for a particular ad. In this project, I'm providing some guidelines for developing a model to predict click-through rate for ads without prior information. In addition, at the end of article
