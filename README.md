# Data Sience Portfolio

I have created this portfolio to explian my science journey and my learnings during this journey with a public audience. I'll try to communicate some technical stuffs in a simple language. I'll add my plog posts, codes, presentations and so on in the form of codes, Python dash, R shiny, iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files. Previously, I have written the description of some of these projects in Internetrix blog.

## 1. [CLV Measurement Tutorial](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/CLV%20Calculation%20Tutorial) 

In this project, in  I provide an extended tutorial that contains all the satges of CLV measurment. It can be useful for both students and practitioners.


I'm going to extend this project by building a Shiny R app that can be used as a toy tool to test diffrent hypothesis and different if-then Senarios. Please let me know if you like to collaborate in this app. 

## 2. [Markov Chain and Attribution modelling](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/CLV%20Attribution)

In This project, I have introduced an novel approach to use Markov graph in attribution modelling, and showed how this approach can be customised by incorporating all the customersâ€™ life cycles.

## 3. [Survival Analysis in Digital Marketing](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/Attribution-Survival-Analysis) 

In this project we are building a Decision Support System to determine the credit of each marketing channel by using a survival analysis approach. The article here explain the framework and mathodlogoy and w'll be updted in the future. 

## 4. [Click Through Rate Prediction](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/CTR%20Prediction)

It is critical to have accurate model that helps us predict the click through rate and also enables us to run if-then scenarios that
discover the best features for a particular ad. In this project, I'm providing some guidelines for developing a model to predict click-through rate for ads without prior information. In addition, at the end of article

## 5. [Baysian A B testing](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/Bayesian%20A%20B%20testing)

Here I have addes some mathematical point regarding A B testing. We are builing a dashboard that use A/B test data as the input and returns Bayesian results as well as their interpretations as the outcome. 

## 6. [Customised Strategy with CLV](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/CLV%20Visualization)

In order to determine the effect of a new product on the retention of customers, we should look for differences.
This projuct introdues differnt visualisations that helps us to analysing differences in terms of acquisition channels or demographic characteristics (such as gender, age or geography) and so on. 

I'm building a we-based app using Python dash library. Let me know if you are interested in collaboration. 

## 7. [TV Advertisement Attribution](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/TV%20Attribution)

How can you measure the effect that TV advertising is having on web traffic and sales for your business? We have introduced a novel approach to measure the measure the impact of an event (such as a TV advertisement) on the traffic of your website by using causal
inference measured.

## 8. [Marketing Budget Optimisation](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/tree/master/Budget%20Optimization)

I used some guidlines to  use linear programming to allocate budget to each marketing activity and at the same time cover all the constraints. This can be accessed [here](https://github.com/mehdifarhangian/portfolio/blob/master/Budget%20Optimization/_Budget_optimisation.pdf) Also, I'm working on a simulation model that allows marketers to conduct various if-then seanrios.
